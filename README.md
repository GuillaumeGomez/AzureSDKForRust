# Microsoft Azure SDK for Rust

Given the success of Rust in general and this repository in particular, we at Microsoft decided it was due time to migrate it in the [Microsoft Azure
](https://github.com/Azure) organization. The new repo - still unofficial and unsupported - is here [https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust). While unoffical and unsupported this step marks the "adulthood" of this repository and it will hopefully attract more talent from the community. 

I took care to migrate all the commits so you will find all the code history there, **along with your contributions** of course!

> :construction: :construction: Please refer to the [new repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust) from now on. 

This repository have been made read-only for your convenience. 

## :two_hearts: Thank you for your involvement and effort, this important step would not have been possible without **you**! :two_hearts:
